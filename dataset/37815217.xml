Six patients from five families were found to have DOCK8 deficiency.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Median age at diagnosis was 7.5&#x2005;years (range: 2-13&#x2005;years), with a male-female ratio of 5:1. Recurrent eczematous skin lesions were the predominant cutaneous manifestation present in 83% (5/6) of the patients. Warts and molluscum contagiosum were evident in 33% (2/6) and 16% (1/6) of the patients, respectively. Two patients had recalcitrant prurigo nodularis lesions and two had epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)-like lesions. Food allergies and asthma were reported by one patient each. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections were detected in 83% (5/6) of the patients. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven non-Hodgkin lymphoma with liver metastases was the only case of malignancy in a 4-year-old boy. IgE was elevated in all patients. Lymphopenia and eosinophilia were observed in 3/6 patients (50%) and 5/6 patients (83.3%), respectively. Genetic analysis showed homozygous deletion mutations in 2 patients, compound heterozygous deletion mutations in 1, and homozygous nonsense mutations in 2. A novel pathogenic homozygous missense variant in the DOCK8 gene was identified in one patient.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">DOCK8 deficiency should be considered as a possibility in any patient with early onset eczema, cutaneous viral infections and increased predisposition to allergy, autoimmunity and malignancy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.
